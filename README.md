# Mspec

The lightest-weight spec framework in ruby. Built for learning at [Makers](https://makers.tech).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'm-spec'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install m-spec

## Usage

We care about isolating unit tests, so there's a very simple mocking library.

```ruby
# source code
class Animal
  def roar
    "ROAAAARRRR!"
  end
end

# test code
describe 'The Animal' do
  it 'can roar' do
    animal = Animal.new
    expect(animal.roar).to eq "ROAAAARRRR!"
  end

  it 'gives a lovely red when it fails' do
    animal = Animal.new
    expect(animal.roar).to eq "little roar!"
  end
end

describe 'stubbing' do
  it 'we can mock too!' do
    mock = test_double
    allow(mock).to receive(:speak) { 'Hello!' }
    expect(mock.speak).to eq 'Hello!'
  end
end
```

To run your specs, pass the spec file directly as an argument. You have to run individual spec files.

```sh
$ m-spec ./spec/animal_spec.rb
```

```
The Animal
  returns a string
  fails nicely
  /path/to/directory/app/spec/animal_spec.rb:11:in block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'
stubbing
  we can mock too!
```

It's got simple one-level indentation and simple colour coding for test passes and failures. Failures will give you only the spec file path and line number.

Remember - you'll have to manage test setup and test cleanup yourself, while keeping your test code dry also yourself. Make sure each test runs in isolation.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
