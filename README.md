# Mspec

The lightest-weight spec framework in ruby. Built for learning at [Makers](https://makers.tech). You have one matcher, the comparison matcher, and test setup and teardown is your responsibility. For additional features, you must extend the gem.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'm-spec'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install m-spec

## Usage

We care about isolating unit tests, so there's a very simple mocking library.

```ruby
# source code
class Animal
  def roar
    "ROAAAARRRR!"
  end
end

# test code
describe 'The Animal' do
  it 'can roar' do
    animal = Animal.new
    expect(animal.roar).to eq "ROAAAARRRR!"
  end

  it 'fails nicely' do
    animal = Animal.new
    expect(animal.roar).to eq "little roar!"
  end
end

describe 'stubbing' do
  it 'we can mock too!' do
    mock = test_double
    allow(mock).to receive(:speak) { 'Hello!' }
    expect(mock.speak).to eq 'Hello!'
  end
end
```

To run your specs, pass the spec file directly as an argument. You have to run individual spec files.

```sh
$ m-spec ./spec/animal_spec.rb
```

```
The Animal
  returns a string
  fails nicely
    Expected: ROAAAARRRR!
    Got: little roar!
    # /path/to/directory/spec/animal_spec.rb:11:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'
stubbing
  we can mock too!
```

It's got simple one-level indentation, simple colour coding for test passes and failures, and simple failure messages with expected and actual values and the failing spec file path and line number.

Remember - you'll have to manage yourself: test setup and teardown, keeping test code dry, each test running in isolation, and loading source code properly.

## Extending

After checking out the repo
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:dearshrewdwit/m-spec.git
$ cd m-spec
```
Add more matchers, or extend the mocking library. Then build locally and use.
```sh
bundle exec rake build --trace
gem install pkg/m-spec-[version].gem
m-spec [spec-file]
```

## Pushing to Rubygems
Sign up for an account, check for the gem name you want, change the gem metadata to represent what you want, and then follow the hints and errors when you
```sh
$ bundle exec rake release
```

[Bundler docs](https://bundler.io/guides/creating_gem.html) are a good resource, as are the [rubygems docs](https://guides.rubygems.org/publishing/)
