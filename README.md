# Mspec

The lightest-weight spec framework in ruby

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mspec'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mspec

## Usage

Remember - you'll have to manage test setup and cleanup yourself.

```ruby
class Animal
  def roar
    "ROAAAARRRR!"
  end
end

describe 'The Animal' do
  it 'can roar' do
    animal = Animal.new
    expect(animal.roar).to eq "ROAAAARRRR!"
  end

  it 'gives a lovely red when it fails' do
    animal = Animal.new
    expect(animal.roar).to eq "little roar!"
  end

  describe 'stubbing' do
    it 'we can mock too!' do
      mock = test_double
      allow(mock).to receive(:speak) { 'Hello!' }
      expect(mock.speak).to eq 'Hello!'
    end
  end
end
```

## Development
